# Rain-Prediction-Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. The dataset "Rain in Australia" used in this analysis contains approximately 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia, obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

## Files
Two Jupyter notebooks are included in this project:

1. Rainfall_prediction.ipynb

Covers EDA, preprocessing, and outlier handling. Outputs "Preprocessed_Data.csv."

Also, Includes classification with Logistic Regression (No Feature Selection)

3. Feature_selection.ipynb
   
Uses "Preprocessed_Data.csv" for feature selection with logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Compares results.

The dataset file "weatherAUS.csv" is included in the project for convenience.

## Requirements
Python

Jupyter Notebooks

Dependencies: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.
